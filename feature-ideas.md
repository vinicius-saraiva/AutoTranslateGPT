## Feature Ideas

- Add a check that flags every translation that contains the word "iBanFirst" so that we don't have issues with cobranding
- Add a check that correctly writes iBanFirst instead of ibanfirst or Ibanfirst, etc...
- A AI checker that goes through the original english text and suggests improvements before translating to the other languages
- Button for automatic upload to localise
- Remove 'load project' button since we're not using it anymore
- Loading state that shows a useless fact from https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/
