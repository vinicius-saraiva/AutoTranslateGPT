# Feature Ideas

## Translation Quality Improvements
- ✅ Add to the prompt that you are a translation tool that works with asset ids that are then associated to translations in various languages
- ✅ Pass on asset id as context to the AI
- ✅ Glossary function: if Asset ID is exactly the same as the one in the glossary, then use directly the translation from the glossary
- ✅ Send asset ids with the same structure with the asset id to be translated so that the AI keep in use the group of asset ids to make them consistent
- Always send tone / pronouns to be used in the translation (eg in French always use formal vous, while in Italian always use informal tu)
- Something to better handle date formats like DD/MM/YYYY maybe add it to the glossary prompt

## Brand Consistency
- Add a check that flags every translation that contains the word "iBanFirst" so that we don't have issues with cobranding
- Add a check that correctly writes iBanFirst instead of ibanfirst or Ibanfirst, etc...
- A AI checker like a MAGIC WAND that goes through the original english text and suggests improvements before translating to the other languages

## UI/UX Improvements
- Button for automatic upload to localise
- Remove 'load project' button since we're not using it anymore
- Add flag function for translations to review later
- Checkboxes that allow you to select which asset ids to translate
- When translation is done, send a notification via chrome to the user

## Loading States (Fun Features)
