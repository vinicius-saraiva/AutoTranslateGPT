## Feature Ideas

- Glossary function: if Asset ID is exactly the same as the one in the glossary, then use directly the translation from the glossary
- send asset ids with the same structure with the asset id to be translated so that the AI keep in use the group of asset ids to make them consistent
- Add a check that flags every translation that contains the word "iBanFirst" so that we don't have issues with cobranding
- Add a check that correctly writes iBanFirst instead of ibanfirst or Ibanfirst, etc...
- A AI checker that goes through the original english text and suggests improvements before translating to the other languages
- Button for automatic upload to localise
- Remove 'load project' button since we're not using it anymore
- Loading state that shows a useless fact from https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/
- loading state that shows a random language fact from language-facts.txt
- loading state that shows a fact for the number of translations http://numbersapi.com/#42
- loading state showing animation https://giphy.com/gifs/animation-app-arabic-xUA7b2IKWCcvHAxVDi; https://media.tenor.com/b8-LGGkm5TgAAAAM/chippy-the-dog-chippy.gif; 
- something to better handle date formats like DD/MM/YYYY maybe add it to the glossary prompt...
- always send tone / pronouns to be used in the translation (eg in French always use formal vous, while in Italian always use informal tu)
- add flag function for translations to review later
- when translation is done, send a notification via chrome to the user
